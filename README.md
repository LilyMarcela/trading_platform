Trading Platform - Overview and Flow
How the App Works (For Non-Technical People)
The trading platform allows users to create, customize, and execute trading strategies based on market data. Here's a simple breakdown of how it works:

User Registration and Login:

Users sign up by creating an account. After registering, they can log in to access the platform.

Creating a Strategy:

Once logged in, users can create their own trading strategies or select pre-built ones. These strategies use financial data, like stock prices, to make decisions on when to buy or sell.
Running a Strategy:

After creating a strategy, users can run it against the latest market data (or historical data for testing). The strategy analyzes the data and generates "signals" (instructions) to either buy or sell stocks or other assets.
Viewing Results:

Users can see the results of their strategies in real-time. The app will tell them whether the strategy suggests buying, selling, or holding an asset.
If the strategy is used in real-time, it tracks actual trades and stores this information.
Backtesting:

Backtesting allows users to see how their strategies would have performed in the past using historical data. This gives them an idea of how effective the strategy might be.
Notifications:

Users are notified when their strategy generates a signal (e.g., when it's time to buy or sell). Notifications can be sent via email, SMS, or directly within the app.
Overview for Technical Users
The trading platform is a Django-based application with an API-only architecture. It allows users to create, customize, run, and backtest trading strategies. Here's an outline of the key features and how the app is built:

1. User Registration and Authentication
   Registration and Login are handled via Django's built-in authentication system.
   Token-based authentication is used for the API, allowing users to log in and make authenticated requests.
2. Strategy Management
   Users can create, update, list, and delete strategies via the API using Django REST Framework's ModelViewSet.
   Each strategy belongs to a user and can be customized with various parameters.
   Strategies can be pre-built (with default configurations) or custom-made by users.
   Parameters are dynamically stored in the StrategyConfiguration table using a key-value approach, which eliminates the need for database migrations when new parameters are added.
3. Strategy Execution
   When a strategy is run, the platform fetches market data (e.g., using external libraries like yfinance).
   The strategy processes the data and generates signals (buy/sell instructions).
   These signals are stored in the database and can result in actual trades.
4. Backtesting
   Users can backtest strategies using historical market data. This evaluates the performance of a strategy in the past, allowing users to understand potential outcomes.
   Metrics like Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and total return are calculated and stored in the database for review.
5. Signals and Trades
   Signals are generated when a strategy recommends a buy or sell action. These signals are stored in the database and are associated with the relevant strategy.
   If a signal results in an actual trade, the trade details (price, quantity, etc.) are stored in the Trades table.
6. Notifications
   Notifications are generated when a signal is created. These can be sent via email, SMS, or as in-app alerts. The details are stored in the Notifications table.
7. Admin Interface
   The Django Admin interface allows superusers to manage users, strategies, signals, trades, and notifications from a UI.
   Database Design Overview
   users table: Stores user information such as username, email, password, and the date the account was created.

strategies table: Stores strategy information like the name, description, status (active, paused, or completed), and whether the strategy is pre-built or custom. It is related to the user that created the strategy.

strategy_configurations table: Stores dynamic parameters (key-value pairs) for each strategy. This allows flexibility in adding and updating parameters without database migrations.

backtests table: Stores the results of backtests, including performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, total return, and maximum drawdown.

historical_price_data table: Stores historical price data (open, close, high, low, and volume) for use in backtesting and strategy execution.

sentiment_data table: Stores sentiment analysis scores related to stocks or other assets. This could be used by strategies that incorporate sentiment-based decisions.

trades table: Stores actual trade data, including the stock symbol, price, quantity, and the time of execution.

signals table: Stores buy or sell signals generated by strategies. Each signal records the stock symbol, signal type (buy/sell), signal price, and whether it was executed.

notifications table: Stores notifications sent to users regarding signals or trades. Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or within the app.

execution_logs table: Logs related to the execution of strategies, including any errors, trades, or signals generated.

API Endpoints Overview
User Management:

Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts via API endpoints.
Token authentication allows users to interact with the platform securely.
Strategies:

API endpoints allow users to create, update, delete, and list their strategies.
Users can customize their strategies by passing configuration parameters (e.g., MACD periods).
Run Strategy:

Users can run their strategies against real-time or historical market data.
The strategy generates signals, and users are notified when a buy or sell action is triggered.
Backtesting:

Backtesting endpoints allow users to simulate their strategies using historical market data and view the performance results.
App Flow
User registers and logs in.
User creates a strategy, either custom or from a pre-built template.
User runs the strategy:
Market data is fetched, and the strategy generates signals.
Signals may result in trades, and trades are logged in the database.
Users are notified when a signal or trade is triggered.
User backtests their strategy using historical data to see how it would have performed in the past.
User views results and adjusts their strategy if needed.
